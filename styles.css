/* 
Design Notes
Photo gallery portion of the page: CSS grid. 
Other parts: whatever CSS layout technique(s) you feel are the best choice.

Some notes on the design from your UX designer:

Sans-serif font
Page background colour is #cccccc
Header background color: #120323
Company name & image bottom border: #97bf04
Navigation & footer background colour: #d9043d
Any spacing not defined can be estimated
Ensure you don't use pixels for anything other than image widths and border sizes. All other units should be relative (rem, em, %, etc.)
Each photo has a 10px border on the bottom
Each gallery image should scale according to the size of its container, up to 650px in width, and be centered in its container
